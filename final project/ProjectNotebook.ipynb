    "Animal Crossing is a very popular game across the word now. Players can do a lot of activities in the game, such as catch bugs, build houses, and fishing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a player who loves fishing and wanting to collect all the species, knowing what months each fishies are available is crutial to me. Therefore, my idea for this project is to create a chatbot that tells user the months that each kinds of fishes are available for both Southern hemisphere and Northern hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## setup:\n",
    "1. I searched the fishes info chart online and typed all the fishes as keys in a single dictionary and all the months information as values.\n",
    "2. I also mimic the tone that the characters in animal crossing usually use.\n",
    "3. Finally, I listed an outline for what the input and output for the chatbot.\n",
